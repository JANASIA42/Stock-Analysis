# Stock-Analysis
Module 2

## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve's parents determine whether their invenstment in DQ stock was a sound one, and/or whether there were other stocks they could invest in that had better returns for 2017 and 2018.

## Results: 

All stocks had positive returns in 2017, with the exception of TERP.
Then in 2018 almost all stocks tanked, with the exception of ENPH and RUN, both of which almost doubled.  
If Steve's parents only could invest in one stock, I would recommend ENPH, as it was the only stock that did consistently well in both 2017 and 2018.
RUN would also be a good investment; although the return wasn't that impressive for 2017, it took off in 2018 and may have another impressive run in 2019.

## Pros and Cons of Refactoring: 

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Refactoring makes for a "cleaner" code, and shortens the amount of time the script needs to run.
However, refactoring usually means you are jumping into a code written by someone else, and it might take a lot of time to map out their thought process in order to determine where/how best to refactor their code.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The above both applied here, as it did indeed take me a long time to figure out the refactoring, but the scripts did run faster.
